      <p>
         Never being one to settle, I was determined to find where I would make my impact on the world. Was that in advertising? It appreared not. But isn't that exactly what I majored in for college? It sure was. Where does that leave me? Right where I want to be. 

         Finding the MERNing. Yes... the MEAN stack would have worked better for my not so clever wordplay. More excited than ever about where my life is taking me, I've finally taken a shot on what it is I really want to do.
